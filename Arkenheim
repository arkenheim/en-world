## Behind the Scenes
### The name "Arkenheim"
The word "Arkenheim" was created by [me](/authors/James) for another D&D world that was never completed. When [Conner](/authors/Conner) began creating a new D&D world it had a name that neither of us were too fond of so "Arkenheim" was changed to "Arkenhein" and lent to that project. When I began this online Wiki-of-sorts, I changed the name back to "Arkenheim".

The word "Arkenheim" doesn't mean anything in any language (as far as I can tell) but in a few Germanic languages, the constituant parts "Arken" and "heim" mean "ark" and "world" respectively.
